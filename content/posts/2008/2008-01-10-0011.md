RTFM stands for "Read The Fucking Manual". This is the story for youâ€¦

\========================================================================

One day a Novice came to the Master.  
"Master," he said, "How is it that I may become a Writer of Programs?".  
The Master looked solemnly at the Novice.  
"Have you in your possession a Compiler of Source Code?" the Master asked.  
"No," replied the Novice. The Master sent the Novice on a quest to the Store of Software.

Many hours later the Novice returned.  
"Master," he said, "How is it that I may become a Writer of Programs?".  
The Master looked solemnly at the Novice.  
"Have you in your possession a Compiler of Source Code?" the Master asked.  
"Yes," replied the Novice.  
The Master frowned at the Novice.  
"You have a Compiler of Source. What now can prevent you from becoming a Writer of Programs?".  
The Novice fidgeted nervously and presented his Compiler of Source to the Master.  
"How is this used?" asked the Novice.  
"Have you in your possession a Manual of Operation?" the Master asked.  
"No," replied the Novice.  
The Master instructed the Novice as to where he could find the Manual of Operation.

Many days later the Novice returned.  
"Master," he said, "How is it that I may become a Writer of Programs?".  
The Master looked solemnly at the Novice.  
"Have you in your possession a Compiler of Source Code?" the Master asked.  
"Yes," replied the Novice.  
"Have you in your possession a Manual of Operation?" the Master asked.  
"Yes," replied the Novice.  
The Master frowned at the Novice.  
"You have a Compiler of Source, and a Manual of Operation. What now can prevent you from becoming a Writer of Programs?".

At this the Novice fidgeted nervously and presented his Manual of Operations to the Master.  
"How is this used?" asked the Novice.  
The Master closed his eyes, and heaved a great sigh.  
The Master sent the Novice on a quest to the School of Elementary.

Many years later the Novice returned.  
"Master," he said, "How is it that I may become a Writer of Programs?".  
The Master looked solemnly at the Novice.  
"Have you in your possession a Compiler of Source Code, a Manual of Operation and an Education of Elementary?" the Master asked.  
"Yes," replied the Novice.  
The Master frowned at the Novice.  
"What then can prevent you from becoming a Writer of Programs?".

The Novice fidgeted nervously. He looked around but could find nothing to present to the Master.  
The Master smiled at the Novice.  
"I see what problem plagues you." said the Master.  
"Oh great master, please tell me." asked the Novice.

The Master turned the Novice toward the door, and with a supportive hand on his shoulder said, "Go young Novice, and Read The Fucking Manual." And so the Novice became enlightened.
