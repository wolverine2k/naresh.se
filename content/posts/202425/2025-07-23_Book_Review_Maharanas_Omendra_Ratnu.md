Theology and history goes hand in hand and should be read by any seeker of knowledge. History is the keystone to understanding the present and the future. Learning about history has a great impact on development of critical thinking skills, fostering of empathy and cultural awareness as well as shaping of individual and group identity. Connecting past events to current circumstances gives us a unique perspective of understanding human behavior, societal changes and complexities of the world we live in. Many of the so called "unsolvable" problems of the world haven't been approached with critical thinking either because of lack of historical context or because of ignorance of the past.

[Maharanas: A Thousand Year War For Dharma by Omendra Ratnu](https://www.prabhatbooks.com/author/omendra-ratnu.htm) is a book that explores the history of the Maharanas, a powerful dynasty that ruled over the Indian subcontinent for over a thousand years. The book has provided detailed accounts of various Maharanas and their reigns, as well as the political and social context of their times and their impact on the Indian subcontinent. The preface of the book goes into the details of how Indian history has been manipulated to propogate defeatist narratives and falsehoods in the consciousness of our great "Bharatiya" civilization.

Maharanas is a detailed chronological report of the glorious resistance put up by one single (Sisodia) family against the islamic invaders for an uninterrupted thousand year period. The real history of India has been completely and methodically erased by the history books while plunderers and murderers have been glorified and celebrated. The book also exposes the falsehood of a "thousand years of Hindu Slavery" myth. Until now, reading the history books of India, one would get an impression that the local Hindu populace was a bunch of culturless nomads with no sense of identity and all good things were brought by the islamic invaders and the britishers. Maharanas exposes the truth that Hindus were the ones who resisted and fought back against the invaders. 

Indian history has been largely ignored and the worst kind of atrocities committed by the invaders have been glorified and celebrated. Until now, it would be very hard (almost impossible) for a seeker of knowledge and history to go to the core and unearth the truth & crush the lies propogated for the last 80+ years by the leftists/marxists (so called) historians of India.

The book has 18 chapters. The first part has 8 chapters on kings of the Sisodia dynasty, starting from Bappa Rawal, Rawal Khuman II, Rawal Jaitra Singh, Rawal Ratan Singh, Maharana Hammir Singh, Mahara Lakshya Singh, Maharan Kumbhkarana SIngh, Maharana Sangram Singh. Part-II takes a deeper look into the activities of Maharana Pratap Singh (the most celebrated and wellknown king of Mewar) and his successful campaign against Akbar. The battles of Maharana Pratap are detailed in the next few chapters. The last parts exposes the lies and falsehoods propogated by the history books in Indian academic media.

I have just finished the preface and am mesmerized by the book. The whole book and the associated argumentation is very well articulated pointing to historical facts with references. I urge every real seeker of knowledge and every real Hindu to read the book. I will keep updating this post as I read the book.

Enjoy!
