India has been suffering from terrorists attacks since the last 1400 years! This terrorism is based on religion and the religious principles embibed in the religious book. In the latest spate of attacks, on 22nd April 2025, terrorists opened fire on a group of tourists killing at least 28 peiple and injuring more than 20 others. These tourists were asked their names, religion and checked for circumcision before being killed. Partial details of the attack is captured in [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Pahalgam_attack).

I am beyond devastated today. Innocent people are being killed by terrorists posing as "Liberation Fighters". Yes, the latest massacre was carried out by the terrorist group ["The Resistance Front (TRF)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_Front). Anybody with half a brain can go through the founders, patrons, flags, vision, objectives, etc. of all terrorists groups across the world and reach the conclusion that there is only one thing uniting them against humanity in general and religion in particular.

In October of 2023, Israel saw another massacre by similar "resistance fighters" who killed thousands of innocents. And we still have the leftists & woke people supporting these massacres! There has been [48035 Islamist terrorist attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Islamist_terrorist_attacks) between 1979 and 2021. Detailed data of Islamist terrorist attacks all over the world is maintained by the French think tank [fondapol.org](https://www.fondapol.org/app/uploads/2024/10/enquete-terrorisme_2021_gb_2024-09-30_w.pdf).

We the people, we the innocent, we the unarmed need to stand-up and talk about this disease plagueing the world. It is time to say this is it and we have had enough. The governments and institutions of the world need to understand the philosophy and ideology behind these terrorist attacks. To fool gullible people, terms like "Liberation", "Resistance", "freedom fighters" etc. are being used by terrorists. Their ultimate goal is to KILL. No amount of education, money, luxury, etc. can bring about a change in the religious doctrination that happens to the terrorists during their whole life.

Imagine if Adolf Hitler would have created a religion based on his ideas in Mein Kampf! Would he have been accepted just because he wrapped his ideas in a religion and gave it divine authority? This is the question that needs to be asked and posed to all the wokes, liberals, secularists. Is it acceptable to kill innocent people in the guise of a religion and/or religious book?

During WWII, [8 million Germans (10% of the population)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification#:~:text=Overview,-A%201948%20denazification&text=About%208%20million%20Germans%2C%20or,of%20German%20Women%2C%20and%20others.) had been a member of Nazi party. The silent majority of 72 million did not subscribe to the extremist views of the Nazis. Still the Nazis killed [6 Million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust) jews in a span of 5 years (1941-1945). The lesson is simple. A silent majority can do nothing. And a silent majority which does not stand-up against extremist views and extremist ideology is bound to be overcome by the extremists. History repeats itself.

[24.1% of the world population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world#:~:text=Demographics,-See%20also%3A%20Muslim&text=More%20than%2024.1%25%20of%20the,come%20from%20diverse%20ethnic%20backgrounds.) (estimated to be 1.9 Billion people) follows Islam. [7% of the muslims world-wide](https://oic-oci.org/upload/islamophobia/2014/en/8MB-aug-en.pdf) agreed to the [September 11 Twin-tower attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks). I am quoting the figure of 7% from the ["Islamophobia Report-August 2014"](https://oic-oci.org/upload/islamophobia/2014/en/8MB-aug-en.pdf) published by [Organization of Islamic Cooperation](https://oic-oci.org/). [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2017/08/09/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/) throws more light on the numbers.

The aim of the terrorists is pretty clear. The silent majority is irrelevant. Everyone including the silent muslims have to wake up and voice their opinions. Everyone needs to stop supporting terrorism and killing of innocents. No reason can justify killing innocent people even if it is ordained by GOD. Either you support terrorists or you don't. There is no middle ground. There is no justification. There is no resistance. There is no liberation. Governments have to unite and take the cancer out before it becomes uncurable. If the religion is in need of reforms, the reforms has to happen. In this age of information and science, there should be no acceptability for animalistic, medieval behaviors in any society of the world.

I commiserate with the affected people and victims of this terrorist attack and offer my condolences. I also hope and pray that the parasitic behavior of the terrorists groups is curtailed and eliminated from the world quickly and effectively; like the Nazi scum that was eliminated after WWII. People were not told to cooperate with Nazis, instead an active action was taken to eliminate them. Similarly, there is no point in talking with terrorists, active elimination is the only option.

Om Shanti!
