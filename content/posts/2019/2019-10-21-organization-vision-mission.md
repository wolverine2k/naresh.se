Vision for an organization is, _“what the person, team or organization wants to create in its best possible future. It is an evocative description of what is possible. A vision is not “something out there” that is impractical, but a way of setting a compelling scenario. Creating this image of the future requires the ability to expand one’s sense of possibilities and then focus on what new initiatives can lead to success”_\[1\].

The mission for an organization is defined as _“the core purpose for which a person, team or organization is created. It is summarized in a clear, short, inspiring statement that focuses attention in one clear direction by stating the purpose of the individual’s, business’s or group’s uniqueness”_\[1\].

To create a vision, one needs to follow a 5-step visioning sequence as described in \[1\].

1. Clarify Values - Define key values and what they mean in action
2. Scan the current situation - Examine the current environment internally and externally
3. Define the mission - Clarify the basic purpose
4. Create a vision - Generate a clear image of the preferred future
5. Implement the vision - Create strategic plans, action plans, and feedback loops to implement the values, vision and mission

Vision helps bring people together around a common dream. It also helps in work coordination and team collaboration by helping everyone make a rational decision supported by clear vision and mission statements. It also helps build the foundation for business planning and make incongruent and/or non-compliant behavior more noticeable. Vision is also a compass allowing for recognition of core competencies and creates awareness of the current reality as well as provides a map to pave the way to produce a shared future.

Vision captures the minds, hearts, and spirits, giving people a higher purpose for their actions. A vision paints a picture of how the organization will be in the future. The vision tends to evolve but needs to be big enough so that it does not substantially change every few years\[1\]. Besides defining a proper vision and mission statement, the organizations also need to communicate the same both internally and externally to various stakeholders, employees, customers, and prospective markets. A proper communication plan, in the end, results in alignment, empowerment, respect, interdependence, innovation, and commitment on the part of the individuals and groups within the organization.
