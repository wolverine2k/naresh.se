[Netgear R6220 router](https://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/wifi-routers/R6220.aspx) an AC1200 dual-band router with very impressive specs. It was awarded the best router in 2016 and now in 2019, I still think it is a very good router. It has a 2 core Mediatek MT7621 (MIPS) processor with 128 MB RAM &amp; 128 MB ROM i.e. ample space with some good processing power. Below you can see the impressive specs. BTW: I got this for almost 15 USD which was a steal!

I am running OpenWRT on this router. You can use the [OpenWRT information page](https://openwrt.org/toh/netgear/netgear_r6220) to install OpenWRT over the stock FW. Now OpenWRT is good but I miss some of the user-friendly features from [Gargoyle FW](https://www.gargoyle-router.com), which is another open source FW based on OpenWRT. One of the best features is the Quota &amp; throttling support in the UI. I can do all these things in OpenWRT but again, it is a lot of manual steps and I also want somebody like my wife to be able to manage the router as well if needed.

The current binaries available for the MT7621 does not have R6220 profile and also, it does not have the latest OpenWRT base. Hence the only option is to compile Gargoyle and create a working FW. Below are the steps for the same. The code below is self-documenting but do ask me your questions in comments as needed.

The original source is: [https://github.com/ericpaulbishop/gargoyle](https://github.com/ericpaulbishop/gargoyle). I have a forked version available at: [https://github.com/wolverine2k/gargoyle](https://github.com/wolverine2k/gargoyle). Start working on the master branch since that is up-to-date and being actively worked upon upstream.

```
git clone git@github.com:wolverine2k/gargoyle.git
cd gargoyle
git checkout master
make ramips.mt7621
```

If the compilation is successful, you should have the necessary binaries generated in: ramips-src/bin/targets/ramips/mt7621

You might face error with  obfsproxy-legacy  which I faced. So I had to apply [the patch](https://github.com/wolverine2k/gargoyle/commit/7e185507cd867838a23d4a753845cf934b132e33) to get it to compile. Now simply do a sysupgrade on your OpenWRT FW to enjoy Gargoyle. I will put another blog post if I find any instabilities. 

More documentation on the same can be found at: [https://www.gargoyle-router.com/wiki/doku.php?id=developer\_documentation](https://www.gargoyle-router.com/wiki/doku.php?id=developer_documentation).

Enjoy going Gargoyle!
