This is for all my friends who want to try out the new VS2010 from Microsoft. It is available for download from Microsoft’s site at: [Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate Beta 2](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=47&p=2&SrcDisplayLang=en&SrcCategoryId=&SrcFamilyId=ef1e4937-1ba0-49a6-8e36-91b5e7e5ce3b&u=details.aspx%3ffamilyid%3dDC333AC8-596D-41E3-BA6C-84264E761B81%26displaylang%3den "http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=47&p=2&SrcDisplayLang=en&SrcCategoryId=&SrcFamilyId=ef1e4937-1ba0-49a6-8e36-91b5e7e5ce3b&u=details.aspx%3ffamilyid%3dDC333AC8-596D-41E3-BA6C-84264E761B81%26displaylang%3den"). You can also download team elements and other stuff. Start coding and testing early. The Beta will expire on 30th June 2010. So it is a lot of time to do some serious coding with this package. This definitely is one of the good things that Microsoft is doing. Of course the final version might be incompatible with this Beta but hey, I can’t rant in this case :).

I have downloaded and am currently installing the package. It is taking an awfully long time but as I said, I am happy they are providing it for trials before hand and giving us a test of the stuff that has been cooked. Enjoy and be prepared for some 2010 code being published on this site.
