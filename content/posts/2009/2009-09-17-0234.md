As I am working a lot with .NET these days, I was looking for some .NET obfuscators along with their license types, features, URLs, etc. I got a link to a nice URL which gives all the Info at: [http://www.csharp411.com/net-obfuscators/](http://www.csharp411.com/net-obfuscators/ "http://www.csharp411.com/net-obfuscators/")

Enjoy & have fun computingâ€¦
